Though it took me a while to turn in this homework it went fairly easily. I had Connor help me again but I understood all the concepts that 
were necessary to complete the assignment. I need to continue reading online documentation for C++ as a lot of it still goes right over my head though I am slowly picking up on the lingo.
Also I apologize for spelling errors... Visual code doesn't have an autocorrect as far as I am aware. At first I did not understand the purpose of the getline function but Connor explained it to me and it made sense.
Also, the counter aspect in the while loop confused me for a few but made sense as it is was tied to the getline function that was used to go line by line in the program. Overall, I learned a lot. I learn significantly
more efficiently when I am actually doing it for myself.
