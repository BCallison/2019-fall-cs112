This exercise proved to be more challenging than pa2. It also took a good while longer. Initially, I was not able to get the cin of the file to work but then realized that I had to include the directory and subsequently prompt the user as such. The next obstacle was to read the file itself going by lines and only getting the data after line 3. Which I got solved though it destroyed the output formatting. The biggest problem was having the program recognize when it was at the third number and to change it to zero. Thats where Connor jumped in and helped me sort it out. Overall, these exercises have been challenging especially compared to the things we were learning in 111. The learning curve is pretty big, but I’m up for the challenge.
